Requirements
------------

Obviously, you'll need Python_.
We normally use Python 3.x, but it *should* also work with Python 2.x.
NumPy_ and SciPy_ are needed for the calculations.
If you also want to plot the resulting sound fields, you'll need matplotlib_.

Instead of installing all of them separately, you should probably get a Python
distribution that already includes everything, e.g. Anaconda_.
